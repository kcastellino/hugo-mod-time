future versions. Hopefully there will be few breaking changes, and warnings will be used where
possible to signal deprecated options.

A module for the [Hugo] static site generator, which generates correctly formatted `<time>` elements.
It also supports ordinals for day formatting. Additionally, it supports including GitHub's
[relative-time-element] package, automatically updating dates and times on the client, according to
their location.

[Hugo]: https://gohugo.io/
[relative-time-element]: https://github.com/github/relative-time-element

##	Installation

Add hugo-mod-time to your Hugo project configuration

-	config.toml

	```toml
	[module]
	[[module.imports]]
	path = 'github.com/kcastellino/hugo-mod-time'
	```

-	config.yaml

	```yaml
	module:
	imports:
	- path: github.com/kcastellino/hugo-mod-time
	```

If you are not using the [client-side time conversion] option, and you don't want to import the
third-party module for that feature, set `ignoreImports` on the module import to `true`:

-	config.toml

	```toml
	[module]
	[[module.imports]]
	path = 'github.com/kcastellino/hugo-mod-time'
	ignoreImports = true
	```

-	config.yaml

	```yaml
	module:
	imports:
	- path: github.com/kcastellino/hugo-mod-time
	  ignoreImports: true
	```

[client-side time conversion]: #enabling-client-side-time-conversion

##	How to use

To insert a date without a time, use the `date` partial with an appropriate format string:

```gotmpl
{{ partial "date" (dict "Time" $time "Format" "2 January 2006") }}
```

To insert a complete datetime, use the `time` partial:

```gotmpl
{{ partial "time" (dict "Time" $time "Format" "2 January 2006 3:04 PM MST") }}
```

Both partials take a dictionary as the 'context' (the single argument), which requires the
following properties:

<dl>
<dt><strong>Time</strong></dt>
<dd>
A <a href="https://godoc.org/time#Time">time.Time</a> struct. Page variables such as
<code>.PublishDate</code> and <code>.Lastmod</code> can be passed straight into this argument;
timestamps can be converted to objects using the <code>time</code> function.
</dd>

<dt><strong>Format</strong></dt>
<dd>
A <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/format/#gos-layout-string">Go Layout String</a> as used by
the <code>time.Format</code> function to render a datetime.
</dd>

<dt><strong>Options</strong></dt>
<dd>
A dictionary containing key-value pairs corresponding to the
<a href="https://github.com/github/relative-time-element#attributes">attributes for the
<code>&lt;relative-time&gt;</code> element</a>
</dd>
</dl>

The `time` partial above will produce the following HTML:

```html
<time datetime="2023-01-30T00:00:00+1100">30 January 2023 12:00 AM AEDT</time>
```

###	Using ordinals in dates

With the `date` and `time` partials, you can also use an ordinal in the layout string to signify
you would like dates to be formatted as such:

```gotmpl
{{ partial "date" (dict "Time" $time "Format" "January 2nd 2006") }}
```

This case is specially handled to produce the following HTML:

```html
<time datetime="2023-01-30">January 30th 2023</time>
```

##	Enabling client-side time conversion

Client-side time conversion is not enabled by default, as it requires including
[relative-time-element] as an additional dependency. To enable it, you need to set
`params.time.enableRelative` in your config to `true`.

-	config.toml:

	```toml
	[params.time]
	enableRelative = true
	```

-	config.yaml:

	```yaml
	params:
	  time:
	    enableRelative: true
	```

You will also need to include the JavaScript files required to enable the custom elements used.
The simple option is to just include the `time/script-import` partial in your `<head>`

```html
<head>
	<!-- omitted -->
	{{ partialCached "time/script-import" dict }}
</head>
```

> Currently, the "context" provided to the `script-import` partial does nothing, however the next
version will instead provide an [options object to js.Build][js-build-options]. If you do not wish
to set any options, you can use the `dict` function with no options to pass an empty dictionary.

Alternatively, you can import `/assets/relative-time-element/index.ts` into your own bundle.

After enabling relative time conversion, the generated HTML will look like this:

```html
<time datetime="2023-01-30T00:00:00+1100">
	<relative-time datetime="2023-01-30T00:00:00+1100"
		month="long" day="numeric" year="numeric"
		hour="numeric" minute="2-digit" timezonename="short">
		30 January 2023 12:00 AM AEDT
	</relative-time>
</time>
```

The template will use the provided layout string to automatically configure the `relative-time`
element so it will match as close as possible to the date format produced by Hugo.

###	Additional options

You may pass in options to change the appearance of the `relative-time` element, by passing in an
options dictionary. You can configure the element using [any available attribute][relative-time-attrs].

```gotmpl
{{ $timeOptions := dict "format" "relative" "precision" "day" "threshold" "P7D" }}

{{ partial "time" (dict "Time" $time "Format" "2 January 2006 3:04 PM MST" "Options" $timeOptions) }}
```

A default configuration can be provided by setting `params.time.defaultOptions` in your site config:

-	config.toml:

	```toml
	[params.time]
	enableRelative = true

	[params.time.defaultOptions]
	format = "relative"
	precision = "day"
	threshold = "P7D"
	```

-	config.yaml:

	```yaml
	params:
	  time:
	    enableRelative: true
	    defaultOptions:
	      format: "relative"
	      precision: "day"
	      threshold: "P7D"
	```
